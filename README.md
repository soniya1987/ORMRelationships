# ORMRelationships
This is an exercise for ORM relationship
We have to create a Person class with our own assumptions
The current state of the application is adding a Person class with the following properties "Id", "Name", "Height", "Weight", "Address", "Employed", "ContactInfo", "State", "Country", "ZipCode".
Future enhancements would be adding relationship to another person like "Spouse", "Children", "Friends" using the same above objects
